# IrisChat

IrisChat is a real-time, anonymous chat application that pairs users randomly for text-based conversations. I wanted to create something Omegle-like to learn more about WebSockets and build a project that isn't heavily dependent on databases. For now, I'm focusing on the backend. Built with Go (Gorilla WebSocket), it provides a seamless and secure chatting experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant text-based communication between paired users.
- **Anonymous Chat**: No personal information is required to start chatting.
- **Random Pairing**: Users are paired randomly in a lobby system.
- **WebSocket Support**: Efficient and low-latency communication using WebSockets.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and intuitive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Gorilla WebSocket)
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (v1.20 or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whotterre/iris_chat.git

   ```

2. **Set Up the Backend**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     go mod download
     ```
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     go run cmd/main.go
     ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **Run with Docker** (optional):
   - Build and run the application using Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

### Usage
